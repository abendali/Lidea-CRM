I want you to build a full-stack web app using:

- React + TypeScript for the frontend
- Node.js + Express + Prisma for the backend
- SQLite as the database
- TailwindCSS for styling

The app is a **store management system** for my e-commerce brand. 
It will have two main sections: 
1. Inventory Management 
2. Cashflow Tracker

The goal is to manage inventory stock levels, record cashflow transactions, and display key metrics on a dashboard.

## 🏗️ GENERAL STRUCTURE

Project should have:

- `/backend` folder with Express + Prisma (API routes, database schema)
- `/frontend` folder with React + TypeScript + Tailwind
- SQLite database file in `/backend/prisma/dev.db`
- Scripts for both backend (`npm run dev`) and frontend (`npm start`)
- Clear `README.md` with setup steps

## 1️⃣ INVENTORY MANAGEMENT

### Data Model:
Product {
  id (int, pk)
  name (string)
  category (string)
  estimatedPrice (float)
  stock (int)
}

StockMovement {
  id (int, pk)
  productId (fk)
  type ('add' | 'subtract')
  quantity (int)
  reason (string)
  note (string)
  date (datetime)
}

### Features:
- Add new product (name, category, estimated price, initial stock)
- Show all products in a table:
  - Name, Category, Unit Price, Stock, Total Value
  - Buttons: Add Stock, Subtract Stock, Delete Product
- When clicking Add/Subtract:
  - Open modal with Quantity + Reason/Note
  - Record movement in `StockMovement` table
- Auto-update product stock
- Summary bar: 
  - Total products, total stock count, total estimated inventory value

## 2️⃣ CASHFLOW TRACKER

### Data Model:
Cashflow {
  id (int, pk)
  type ('income' | 'expense')
  amount (float)
  category (string)
  description (string)
  date (datetime)
}

### Features:
- Show current total balance (Income - Expense)
- Add new transaction:
  - Income or Expense button → modal form (amount, category, description, date)
- Show transactions table with filters (type, date, category)
- Summary stats:
  - Total Income
  - Total Expenses
  - Net Balance
  - Initial Capital (editable)
  - Current Capital = Initial + Net

## 3️⃣ DASHBOARD (Home)

### Show overview cards:
- Total Stock Value
- Total Cash Balance
- Number of Products
- Latest 5 Transactions

---

## 🧩 UI REQUIREMENTS

- Use TailwindCSS for styling (clean, light dashboard theme)
- Sidebar or top navigation: Home | Inventory | Cashflow
- Use React Router for page navigation
- Use modals for adding stock or transactions
- Use local state or Context for basic global stats
- Make it mobile responsive

---

## 📦 TECHNICAL NOTES

- Backend routes: `/api/products`, `/api/stock`, `/api/cashflow`
- Prisma schema with proper relations
- Return JSON for all endpoints
- Frontend consumes API with Axios or Fetch
- Include seed script to create sample data
- Display flash/success messages (React Toastify or similar)

---

Make everything run fully in Replit — both frontend and backend — and ensure database persistence with SQLite. 
The result should be a functional MVP dashboard for managing inventory and cashflow for a small manufacturing e-commerce brand.
